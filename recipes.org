** Sweet and Sour Chicken
[[http://www.melskitchencafe.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken-updated/][Original recipe]]
*** Ingredients
- Chicken
  - 3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 cup cornstarch
  - 2 large eggs, beaten
  - 1/4 cup canola, vegetable or coconut oil
- Sauce
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (depending on how sweet you want the sauce)
  - 4 tablespoons ketchup
  - 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon garlic salt
*** Recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 165 deg C.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and
   pepper. Place the cornstarch in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Put the chicken
   into the bag with the cornstarch and seal, tossing to coat the chicken.
3. Whisk the eggs together in a shallow pie plate. Heat the oil in a large
   skillet over medium heat until very hot and rippling. Dip the
   cornstarch-coated chicken pieces in the egg and place them carefully in a
   single layer in the hot skillet.
4. Cook for 20-30 seconds on each side until the crust is golden but the chicken
   is not all the way cooked through (this is where it's really important to
   have a hot skillet/oil). Place the chicken pieces in a single layer in a
   9X13-inch baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
5. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl and pour over the
   chicken. Bake for one hour, turning the chicken once or twice while cooking
   to coat evenly with sauce. Serve over hot, steamed rice.
